        <center> <h1 class="Page Title">What is Rocket League?</h1> </center>
        <p class="Intro"><br /><br /> Rocket League is a competetive game, all based around rocket powered cars that hits a ball on the field.
        Formally known as SARPCB <dfn>(Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars)</dfn> which was a predecessor to Rocket League. Rocket League is essentially a more complex soccer. 
        In which there are multiple types of game modes, the ones I'll be covering in this short piece is the base game mode itself which is soccer. In soccer there are different types of
        modes, solo duel: Where it's one player verus another player, Doubles: two verus two, and Standard: Which is three verus three. 
        <s>There is also a mode called Chaos in which is four verus four and <big>isn't included in the competitive playlist</big>.</s></p>

        <p class="Competitive"><br /> While there is casual modes in the game I'll be talking about the competitive aspects of the game. In the competitve playlist there are 7 different unique ranks
        ranging from Bronze all the way to Grand Champ <dfn>(Champion is offen called Champ in the scene)</dfn>, the order of ranks are as following: 
        <mark>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Champion, Grand Champion</mark> and <b>each rank has 3 different ranks in it, i.e. Gold 1-3,
        and each rank has 4 different divisions in it, i.e. Gold 1 Div 1-4, Div 5 being the next rank up being Gold 2.</b> The skill gap between the ranks doesn't become apparent till around Platinum
        which is above average rank of the game. Starting at around this rank you start to see players getting a hand of all the different kinds of mechanics the game has to offer. These 
        mechanics are known as <em><strong>ball control, arieal control, kickoffs, and boost control to name a couple basic mechanics</strong></em>. All of these mechanics are self explanitory, 
        ball control is all about how effectively you can control the ball with your car, arieal control is all about how you control your car in the air, kickoffs are all about the kickoff, and finally
        boost control being when you use your boost and how you collect additional boost at the correct times. And not to mention while thinking all about the mechanics of the game you <i>constantly</i>
        <sub>the only time you rest is before kickoffs</sub> need to be making split second decisions. </p>

        <p class="Conclusion"><br /> In basic terms Rocket League is a competitive multiplayer game that has many ranks ranging from Bronze all the way to Grand Champ. It also has a 
        casual mode for those who don't want a competitive experience.</p>
